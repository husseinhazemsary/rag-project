Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" from data, without being explicitly programmed.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables machines to understand and respond to text or voice data in human language.
